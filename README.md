# Improving_the_security_of_LCB_block_cipher_against_Deep-Learning_based_attacks
The code is with association to the paper "Improving_the_security_of_LCB_block_cipher_against_Deep Learning_based_attacks"

**For NISTS tests on Secure LCB:**
Use "SECURE_LCB_FILE_GENERATION.ipynb" to generate the bitstreams of 10^6. 
The no. of sequences can be specified in the loop that calls the function make_train_data.

NIST tests can be found in this link: https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software
