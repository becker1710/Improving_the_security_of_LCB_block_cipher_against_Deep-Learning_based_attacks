# Improving_the_security_of_LCB_block_cipher_against_Deep-Learning_based_attacks
The code is with association to the paper "Improving_the_security_of_LCB_block_cipher_against_Deep Learning_based_attacks"

The file "Original_LCB.ipynb" contains the implementation of LCB and also contains the neural distinguisher proposed. 
The file can be opened using Jupyter notebook or Google Collaborator. 
The .h5 file and .json files can be exported into the code for testing data. 

To generate new .h5 file and .json files, training of the model needs to be done. The code is present in "Original_LCB.ipynb".
